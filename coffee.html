<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;">
There was this one girl sitting in my Physics class,  I never thought that she will be the one because she was my student, we were not close back then until their graduation came, <br>we're starting to talk during that time but it was all about grades and award stuffs, during their graduation, she was devastated because she heard some unwanted talks about her by her own father, rants on social media about that, I messaged her on FB messenger, I cheered her up, that was the start of our unending conversation, I was so broke that time but she managed to make me feel alive, told me that everthing is fine, losing someone is not the end of everything, that was the time that she also started to tell her stories to me, stories about her life, what are the things she don't want something like that, ere like that for almost like a month, we're alwals sleeping late because we are talking with each other, one time i realized that, why are we like this, why are we always reminding one another to eat well, comforting each other and many more, I started to wonder if do I have a feelings for her? a months passed, we are still like that, until I notice that when she is not messaging me, I'm kinda sad, that's the time that i know I really do have feelings for her, One time she asked me if am i gonna have to be part in a relationship again, i said I don't want to be in a rekationship again, because of the traumas, but deep inside me I want to say that if I will be in a relationship again I want her to be the one because I like her. She said that time that she is wondering if there might be someone out there who will love her for real, she said that she want to have a boyfriend, to marry someday, I was hurt, I thought we promised that no one is going to marry and no one is going to have boyfriend/girlfriend on both of us, I was really sad that night, I don't know what to say and how to respond so I did not respond, she noticed the sudden change of my mood, she take back what she said, she said that she will not have boyfriend and that she will not leave me that I am his friend forever and we will be together until the day we die, that time because of sadness, I told her, I have something to tell her, she asked, what is it, i couldn't say it so she forced me, i told differet things just to divert the topic into another topic and she gets annoyed,she told me that that is not the thing that i want to say, turns out she was right because i want to say to her that time that i like her. She asked me again, what is it? what is the thing that you want to say to me?, so I told her, all I want to say is that "This is wrong, I'm starting to like you", I said and then I turned off my phone, but she replied too quickly and in her reply she said, "me too". That is the start of everything</p>
